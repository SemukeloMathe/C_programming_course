# The C Programming Language

This repo will showcase my learning journey to becoming a proficient C developer. Although i'm not new to the language, I do have what I consider little knowledge about the language and I am taking time to fully understand the language proficiently. The repo will be divided into sub directories each having their readmes' explaining what the the directories are about.
